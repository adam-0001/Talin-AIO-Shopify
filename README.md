# Talin-AIO-Shopify

Talin-AIO-Shopify is an open-source auto-checkout module written in GoLang, designed to automate the checkout process on any Shopify store. This proof-of-concept implementation was developed before the introduction of GraphQL checkout APIs for Shopify, so it may not work on the newest stores. The code was one of the first "modules" I created, so it might be a little messy :)

**Important Note:** This code is not intended for use as-is and should only be viewed as a proof of concept (missing dependencies).

## Features

- Product Monitoring and variant selection (with cache bypass)
- Proof of concept implementation of checkout flow (for non-gql stores)
